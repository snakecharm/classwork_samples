            <p>
                Zenos was a child prodigy and advanced quickly through the Garlean military. Quickly 
                growing bored of everyone around him, he found that the only thing that brought him 
                any pleasure was the hunt. Either beast or man, it did not matter as long as it gave 
                him the joy he craved.

        <div class="card3">
            <h2>Bahamut</h2>
            <div class="bio">
                <p>Age: 5,000</p>
            </div>
            <div class="bio">
                <p>Height: 267 miles</p>

            </div>
            <p>
                The original dragon Bahamut had been killed by the Allagan Empire. Enraged, his mate 
                Tiamat gathered many other dragons to summon the spirit of Bahamut. This summoned 
                primal being was not the same as the original but a ravenous beast. The Allagans sealed him 
                inside a false moon with his servants, where he remained for millenia gathering power.
