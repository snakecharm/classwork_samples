      The Last Herald-Mage Trilogy: Magic's Pawn, Magic's Promise, and Magic's Price. This was the first
      series I ever read from her but it was by no means the last. The main protagonist Vanyel is rejected
      by his father but is given a chance to try to enter the Bardic School in Valdemarr. His journey from
      simple noble to legendary mage is one you will come back to again and again.

    <h4 class="review">Dawn by Octavia Butler</h4>
    <img class="book" src="dawn.jpg"
      alt="Image from Amazon https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008HALOEQ/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1">
    <p class="review">Dawn by Octavia Butler is an amazing work of science fiction. Written by one of the first black
      female authors, the heroine Lilith wakes up on an alien ship and must get used to the Oankali that
      have saved what was left of humanity. The reasons for the Oankali saving people is because their
      species uses DNA from other beings to continually evolve. The Oankali themselves are one of the more
      unique aliens in science fiction. They have a third sex that is called ooloi that is how they are able
      to change their DNA.
    </p>
    <p class="review">
      The series continues for two more books that explore the new relationship humans now have with
      the Oankali, focusing on Lilith's children. This is another must read for any science fiction fan.

    <img class="book" src="otherprincess.jpg"
      alt="Image from Goodreads https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43418530-the-other-princess">
    <p class="review">
      This is a Motercycle Romance and also a family drama. It is set in a family who are also part of
      a motercycle club. Ever lost her mother at a young age and is sent to live with her father and
      stepmother. When she is betrayed and humiliated by one she had thought she trusted it causes a
      divide in the club. Someone that had been away and returns sees how they treat her and speaks up,
      showing them just how undeserved their cruelty was.
    </p>
    <p class="review">
      I really liked the dynamic of the family in this. This was about internal group strife that
      needed to be fixed. All the characters felt real and flawed. I would say this is a Motercycle
      Romance for those who want more that just one club fighting another.

    <img class="book" src="abandonedgirl.jpg"
      alt="Image from Author https://www.lexiewinston.com/books-2/book-series/neighpalm-industries-collective/">
    <p class="review">
      Abandoned Girl is the first book in the Neighpalm Industries Collective. It follows Harlow, a
      23 year old who had just finished veterinay school. But when her mother dies she learns that her
      father is a billionare with seven children he had adopted over the years. This first book is her
      meeting her new family. While her father truly wants to get to know her the rest are very bitter.
    </p>
    <p class="review">
      Harlow is another great character. Growing up with a junkie mother has toughened her to a lot
      of things. She takes much of what her fathers adoptees put her through and holds her own. The
      first two books in this series are released on Amazon with two more on the way.

    <img class="book" src="bornofwater.jpg" alt="Image from Author https://www.alknorrbooks.com/">
    <p class="review">
      This is a wonderful introduction to four new characters. Our story revolves around Targa and her
      mother, who are both sirens. One day, the shipwreck salvage team the mother works for gets a
      request to excavate a shipwreck in Poland. Surprizing connections to that shipwreck and the person
      who wanted it excavated appear. Keeping their secret while there becomes more dificult as the trip
      goes on.
    </p>
    <p class="review">
      This is just the start of a wonderful series that begins with 5 friends and how they are pulled
      into the world of Elementals.

    <h4 class="review">Pennies by Pepper Winters</h4>
    <img class="book" src="pennies.jpg" alt="Image from Author https://pepperwinters.com/dollar-series/">
    <p class="review">
      This review comes with a warning. This is a dark book that deals with very heavy topics such
      as human trafficing. If you are triggered by this or find this too traumatizing to read I
      suggest skipping this book. For those that do want to know more this is a tough but amazing
      read. Your heart goes out to "Pim" and what she suffers through. And while her savior is not
      who most would expect he seems to fit.
