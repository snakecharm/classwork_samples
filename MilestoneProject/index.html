    <p>
      A Soldier's Duty is the first book in the Theirs Not to Reason Why series and begins with an
      interesting premise: How do you stop a disaster that will not happenfor 300 years after you are
      dead? Our heroine Ia is what is known as a precog. She has a terrible vision of the future and there
      is only one way to prevent that from happening. This details the start of her journey to keep the
      universe existing. The series is an ode to the military and starts with Ia in boot camp. The author
      made sure to make the militay aspect as accurate as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a great start to an amazing series. Ia's journey through the ranks while working to save
      the known universe is well supported with great details and world building. There are characters
      mentioned that I would love to know more about. This is a great Military Sci-Fi and I highly recommend
      if you have not read anything by Jean Johnson.
